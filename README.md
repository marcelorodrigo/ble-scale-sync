# Renpho Scale → Garmin Connect Sync

A cross-platform CLI tool that reads body composition data from a **BLE smart scale** and uploads it to **Garmin Connect**. Built with an adapter pattern supporting **20+ scale brands** out of the box.

Works on **Linux** (including Raspberry Pi), **macOS**, and **Windows**.

## How It Works

```
┌────────────────┐        ┌────────────────┐        ┌────────────────┐
│   BLE Scale    │  BLE   │   TypeScript   │  JSON  │     Python     │
│  (Bluetooth)   │ ─────> │ BLE + Adapter  │ ─────> │ Garmin Upload  │
└────────────────┘        └────────────────┘        └────────────────┘
```

**TypeScript** (run via `tsx`) scans for a BLE scale, auto-detects the brand via the adapter pattern, and calculates up to 10 body composition metrics. It passes the results as JSON to a **Python** script that uploads to Garmin Connect and returns a structured JSON response.

## Prerequisites

### All Platforms

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- [Python](https://python.org/) 3.9 or later
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capable adapter

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev build-essential python3-pip

# Allow Node.js to access BLE without root
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f $(which node))
```

### macOS

```bash
# Install Xcode command-line tools (required for native modules)
xcode-select --install
```

No additional Bluetooth setup needed — macOS uses its native CoreBluetooth API.

### Windows

1. Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (select "Desktop development with C++").
2. Install [Python](https://python.org/) and check "Add to PATH" during installation.
3. You need a BLE-compatible Bluetooth adapter. Most built-in adapters work, but you may need a [WinUSB driver setup with Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) for generic dongles.

> **Note:** On Windows, `@abandonware/noble` requires the Bluetooth adapter to use WinUSB. See the [noble Windows setup guide](https://github.com/abandonware/noble#windows) for details.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KristianP26/renpho-scale-garmin-sync.git
cd renpho-scale-garmin-sync

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt    # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### 1. Create your `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your personal details:

```ini
GARMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your_password

USER_HEIGHT=183
USER_BIRTH_YEAR=2000
USER_GENDER=male
USER_IS_ATHLETE=true
```

`SCALE_MAC` is **optional**. If omitted, the app auto-discovers any recognized scale during `npm start`. To pin to a specific device, add:

```ini
SCALE_MAC=FF:03:00:13:A1:04
```

### 2. Find your scale's MAC address (optional)

By default, the app auto-discovers your scale — no MAC address needed. If you have multiple BLE scales nearby and want to pin to a specific one, run:

```bash
npm run scan
```

This scans for nearby BLE devices for 15 seconds. Recognized scales are tagged with the adapter name (e.g. `[QN Scale]`, `[Xiaomi Mi Scale 2]`, `[Yunmai]`). Copy the MAC address into your `.env` file.

> **Tip:** On macOS, noble uses UUIDs instead of MAC addresses. The scan output will show the correct identifier to use.

### 3. Authenticate with Garmin Connect

```bash
npm run setup-garmin
```

This logs into Garmin using the credentials in your `.env` and stores authentication tokens locally (default: `~/.garmin_renpho_tokens/`). You only need to do this once — tokens are reused for subsequent syncs.

> **Note:** On Linux/macOS, if `python` is not available, run the script directly with `python3 scripts/setup_garmin.py`.

> **If authentication fails:** Garmin may block requests from certain IPs (especially cloud/VPN IPs). Try running the setup from a different network, then copy the `~/.garmin_renpho_tokens/` directory to your target machine.

## Usage

### Sync your scale

```bash
npm start
```

1. The app scans for your scale via Bluetooth. If `SCALE_MAC` is set, it connects to that specific device; otherwise it auto-discovers any recognized scale.
2. **Step on the scale** and wait for the measurement to stabilize.
3. Once weight and impedance data are received, body composition is calculated and uploaded to Garmin Connect.

### What gets uploaded

| Metric | Unit | Formula |
|---|---|---|
| Weight | kg | Raw scale reading |
| BMI | - | `weight / (height_m)^2` |
| Body Fat | % | BIA: `LBM = c1*(H^2/Z) + c2*W + c3*A + c4`, `BF% = (W - LBM) / W * 100` |
| Water | % | `LBM * 0.73 / W * 100` (athlete: 0.74) |
| Bone Mass | kg | `LBM * 0.042` |
| Muscle Mass | kg | `LBM * 0.54` (athlete: 0.60) |
| Visceral Fat | 1-59 | `BF% * 0.55 - 4 + age * 0.08` |
| Physique Rating | 1-9 | Based on BF% and muscle/weight ratio |
| BMR | kcal | Mifflin-St Jeor: `10*W + 6.25*H - 5*A + s` (athlete: +5%) |
| Metabolic Age | years | `age + (idealBMR - BMR) / 15` |

Where `W` = weight (kg), `H` = height (cm), `A` = age, `Z` = impedance (ohm), `s` = +5 male / -161 female.

BIA coefficients (c1, c2, c3, c4):

| | c1 | c2 | c3 | c4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Male | 0.503 | 0.165 | -0.158 | 17.8 |
| Male (athlete) | 0.637 | 0.205 | -0.180 | 12.5 |
| Female | 0.490 | 0.150 | -0.130 | 11.5 |
| Female (athlete) | 0.550 | 0.180 | -0.150 | 8.5 |

When impedance is not available, body fat is estimated using the Deurenberg formula:
`BF% = 1.2 * BMI + 0.23 * age - 10.8 * sex - 5.4` (sex: 1 = male, 0 = female; athlete: *0.85).

Scales that provide their own body composition values (fat, water, muscle, bone) use those directly — only BMI, BMR, metabolic age, visceral fat, and physique rating are always calculated from the formulas above.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Unit tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and cover the core body composition math in `calculator.ts` and `body-comp-helpers.ts`.

## Adding a New Scale

To support a new scale brand, create a class that implements `ScaleAdapter` in `src/scales/`:

1. Create `src/scales/your-brand.ts` implementing the interface from `src/interfaces/scale-adapter.ts`
2. Define `matches()` to recognize the device by its BLE advertisement name
3. Implement `parseNotification()` for the brand's data protocol
4. Register the adapter in `src/scales/index.ts`

## Athlete Mode

Setting `USER_IS_ATHLETE=true` in `.env` adjusts the calculation constants for people who exercise regularly. This affects:

- **Lean Body Mass** coefficients (higher lean mass estimation)
- **Water percentage** (athletes have higher hydration: 74% vs 73% of LBM)
- **Skeletal Muscle Mass** factor (60% vs 54% of LBM)
- **BMR** (+5% boost)
- **Metabolic Age** (capped at actual age minus 5 for athletes)

## Token Storage

By default, Garmin tokens are stored in `~/.garmin_renpho_tokens/`. You can change this by setting `TOKEN_DIR` in your `.env`:

```ini
TOKEN_DIR=/custom/path/to/tokens
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" on Linux
Make sure you've granted BLE capabilities to Node.js:
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f $(which node))
```

### Scale not found
- Make sure the scale is powered on (step on it to wake it up).
- If using a specific `SCALE_MAC`, verify the address matches (`npm run scan`).
- If using auto-discovery, ensure only one recognized scale is powered on nearby.
- On Linux, ensure the Bluetooth service is running: `sudo systemctl start bluetooth`.

### Garmin upload fails
- Re-run `npm run setup-garmin` to refresh tokens.
- Check that your Garmin credentials in `.env` are correct.
- If you're behind a VPN or on a restricted network, try authenticating from a different connection.

### Windows BLE issues
- Make sure your Bluetooth adapter uses the WinUSB driver (use [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) to switch drivers if needed).
- Run your terminal as Administrator if you encounter permission errors.
